#Overview
This is a repository holding the code for the homework on the questionaire for group 10 in stat 157 at berkeley, fall 2013. Our final version of R-code will be found at **https://github.com/drmeow/Stat157_VerticalGroup10/blob/master/Final_Rcode.R**

#How to reproduce
To be able to reproduce our code, make sure you have the latest verison of R programming language installed on your computer. You can do so by visiting http://www.r-project.org/ and finding a mirror nearest to you, and following the instructions. The developing environment R Studio is also a great tool, found at http://www.rstudio.com/.

**You DO NOT have to download the data. The r-code that we provided will scrap the data from google spread sheet.** The file called ‘Final_Rcode.R’ is the R code that you will need to reproduce all of the things that we’ve done for this assignment. 

We used slide.es to create the slideshow for the presentation, which can be found at https://slid.es/tzenarr/group10/
