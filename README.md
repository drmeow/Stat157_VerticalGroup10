Stat157_VerticalGroup10
=======================

This is a repository holding the code for the homework on the questionaire for group 10 in stat 157 at berkeley, fall 2013


To be able to reproduce our code, make sure you have the R programming language installed on your computer. You can do so by visiting http://www.r-project.org/ and finding a mirror nearest to you, and following the instructions. The developing environment R Studio is also a great tool, found at http://www.rstudio.com/

First, you need to download the data as a csv file from the questionnaire. 

You can find all of our code in the public repository on github where this readme is located, aka, https://github.com/drmeow/Stat157_VerticalGroup10

Then, you can run the data R script to create the workspace needed for the analysis and visualization aspects that are to come. 

By running Analysis.R within the repo, you are given the insights into the data that we built.

You can then run Stat157QuestionnaireHW-Visualizer-SamK.R to produce the visualizations.

We used slide.es to create the slideshow for the presentation, which can be found at https://slid.es/tzenarr/group10/
